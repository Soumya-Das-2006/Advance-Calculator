# üßÆ Advanced Calculator in C++

## üìå Project Description
The **Advanced Calculator** is a console-based C++ program that allows users to perform both **basic arithmetic** and **scientific calculations**.  
It provides a simple **menu-driven interface** where users can select operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more.

## ‚ú® Features
- ‚úÖ Basic Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus.  
- ‚úÖ Scientific Functions: Power, Square Root, Trigonometric (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), Natural Logarithm.  
- ‚úÖ Input Validation & Error Handling:
  - Division by zero check.  
  - Invalid input handling (e.g., log of negative numbers).  
- ‚úÖ Loop-based execution (runs until user exits).  
- ‚úÖ Easy-to-use menu-driven interface.
